      'Several Facebook posts claim that the former chief justice of Nigeria Olukayode Ariwoola has been arrested in the United States. The posts refer to Ariwoola as the judge that declared Bola Tinubu as the winner of Nigerias 2023 presidential election, and claim that US president Donald Trump ordered his arrest.The posts include three images, of Ariwoola, Trump and a plane taking off from an airport.The same claim appears here, here and here.

      'Since his arrest, there have been no credible reports on any diplomatic arrangement for Ekpa’s expatriation from Finland to Nigeria.In an email response to AFP Fact Check, Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) senior detective Mikko Laaksonen, said Finnish police are “not aware of any extradition decision. Gummerus also responded to the claim in an email on April 28, 2025, dismissing it as fake news.Two spokespersons from the Nigerian justice ministry -- Modupe Ogundoro and Kamarudeen Ogundele -- both denied knowledge of Ekpa’s extradition plans in separate phone conversations with AFP Fact Check.',

      'The Facebook posts also list a WhatsApp number, where users can supposedly apply for the positions. This can also be dangerous, as users may be tricked into handing over sensitive information, like identity numbers or bank account details, or even coaxed into paying a fee for a fake interview.The posts also lack any real detail about the supposed jobs. Only listing a salary and a few requirements in a job advert should raise suspicion',

      'No credible media platform has reported a bomb blast in Abuja on 29 April or an assasination attempt on Shettima. It’s therefore very unlikely to be true. Past bomb blasts in Abuja were widely reported by local and international media. This includes the explosion of an improvised explosive device in January, which killed two people in a school near Abuja. There is no evidence of any bomb explosion in Abuja on 29 April. The claim is false',
